# CountingWords_sln
programming test
General considerations while I made the solution:
1.Apply OO design principles
2.Thinking about the efficiency & performance: Using Stream to read file and Dictionary for word count results.
3.Unit testing: Test good common cases, borderline cases and expected exceptions.
